# Description
Still pending official name - for now TM1 IDE will be used.  The goal of TM1 IDE is to implement a development environment with a desktop feel for both rules and processes.  With the onset of the IBM provided Rest API, there has been a proliferation of web-based editors, but nothing that provides a true native experience for the more traditional developer.  This project aims to cut through the feature overload that has become increasingly popular, and provide the average developer with a simple, clean interface that stays out of their way.
